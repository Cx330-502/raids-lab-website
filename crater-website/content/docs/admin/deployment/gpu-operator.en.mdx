## Overview

The **NVIDIA GPU Operator** automates the deployment and management of all necessary components to support GPUs in Kubernetes clusters.

In Crater, it provides:

- GPU driver installation  
- NVIDIA container runtime setup  
- `dcgm-exporter` for GPU monitoring (used by Prometheus stack)  
- Smooth integration with Crater's job scheduling and GPU metrics display

> Crater requires GPU Operator to ensure GPU jobs are correctly scheduled and monitored.

## Installation

We recommend installing GPU Operator via Helm with Craterâ€™s preconfigured values.

ðŸ“¦ Helm values: [`deployments/gpu-operator/values.yaml`](../deployments/gpu-operator/values.yaml)  
ðŸ“– Detailed guide: [`deployments/gpu-operator/README.md`](../deployments/gpu-operator/README.md)
