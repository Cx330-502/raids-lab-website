description: How Crater uses Volcano batch scheduler for multi-lab GPU resource management and distributed workloads.
---

## Overview

[Volcano](https://volcano.sh/en/) is a batch scheduling system designed for high-performance workloads such as AI/ML training, big data, and scientific computing. In Crater, Volcano is used to manage GPU scheduling across multiple labs and users in a fair and preemptive way.

---

## Why Volcano?

We chose Volcano for Crater due to its rich scheduling capabilities, extensible plugin system, and native support for **distributed training**, **fair resource sharing**, and **job-level control**.

Crater leverages the following Volcano components:

- **Queue & Quota CRDs** â€“ Fine-grained GPU resource allocation across labs
- **Preemption (Capacity Plugin)** â€“ Preemptive scheduling among labs and users
- **Job CRD & Plugins** â€“ Native support for distributed tasks
- **Node ordering, job ordering, gang scheduling**, etc.

## Lab-Oriented Queue Design

Crater serves on an academic multi-tenant senario, where GPU clusters are shared by various research labs. To manage resource fairness:

- We create a **`Queue`** per lab (e.g., `lab-a`, `lab-b`)
- Each user is assigned to their respective lab's queue
- A corresponding **`ResourceQuota`** defines the labâ€™s guaranteed GPU capacity
- Volcano's **`capacity` plugin** enforces preemption policies when contention occurs

This design allows:

- Clear **resource boundaries** between labs
- **Soft quotas** that allow opportunistic sharing
- **Priority-based preemption** to avoid resource starvation

---

## Support for Distributed Jobs

Crater uses Volcanoâ€™s [Job CRD](https://volcano.sh/en/docs/job-tutorial/) to support:

- Distributed PyTorch, TensorFlow, or MPI workloads
- Gang scheduling and job dependencies
- Lifecycle management (start, suspend, delete)

We also enable the following scheduling plugins in Volcano:

- `gang` â€“ Ensures pods in the same job start together
- `svc` â€“ Generates a headless service for distributed training
- `priority` â€“ Honors user/job priority
- `numa-aware` â€“ Optional, for performance-sensitive workloads

---

## VLLM Compatibility

We are currently adapting the [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) inference engine to run under Volcano using custom `Job` CRDs. This allows us to treat large model inference as a distributed workload with integrated scheduling, queueing, and quota enforcement.

---

## LLaMA Factory Compatibility

We are also actively extending support for [LLaMA Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory), another fine-tuning project developed by ACT Lab. Integration efforts focus on enabling distributed fine-tuning jobs using Volcano's `Job` CRD, with scheduling awareness for GPU topology, resource quotas, and job orchestration.

## Installation Notes

We recommend installing Volcano via Helm with Craterâ€™s preconfigured values.
