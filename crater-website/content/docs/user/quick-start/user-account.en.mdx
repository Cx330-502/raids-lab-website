title: Users and Accounts
description: As the number of users increases, we may refine the details regarding quotas.

During the closed beta phase, we have not yet opened the full quota capabilities for users and accounts. Currently, each user has no submission limits and is queued according to the FIFO rule, so you do not need to pay attention to this section.

In the future, as the number of users increases, we may refine the details regarding quotas.
