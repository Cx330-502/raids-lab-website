## 🔐 1. Obtain Harbor Access Credentials

### 🚀 1.1 Log in to the Platform

First, log in to your platform (e.g., Kubernetes cluster management platform, CI/CD platform, etc.), and locate the section integrated with Harbor.

### 🔑 1.2 Obtain Access Credentials

On the platform's Harbor integration page, you can find the following information:

- **🌐 Harbor URL**: The address of the Harbor repository, for example `https://harbor.example.com`.
- **👤 Username**: Your Harbor username.
- **🔒 Password**: Your Harbor password.

### 🔐 1.3 Log in to Harbor

Use the obtained credentials to log in to Harbor:

```bash
docker login crater-harbor.act.buaa.edu.cn -u <username> -p <password>
```

After successful login, you will see the prompt `Login Succeeded`. ✅

## 📦 2. Upload Local Image to Harbor Repository

### 🏷️ 2.1 Tag the Local Image

Before uploading, you need to tag the local image to comply with the naming conventions of the Harbor repository. For example:

```bash
docker tag local-image:tag harbor.example.com/project-name/repository-name:tag
```

- `local-image:tag`: Your local image name and tag.
- `harbor.example.com/project-name/repository-name:tag`: The complete path of the Harbor repository, including the project name, repository name, and tag.

Each user's Project Name is `user-{ACT username}`. 💡

### ⬆️ 2.2 Push the Image to Harbor

Use the `docker push` command to push the tagged image to the Harbor repository:

```bash
docker push harbor.example.com/project-name/repository-name:tag
```

After a successful push, you can see the uploaded image in the Harbor repository. ✨

## ✅ 3. Verify Image Upload

### 🌐 3.1 Log in to Harbor Web UI

Open your browser and visit the Harbor Web UI (e.g., `https://harbor.example.com`), and log in using your credentials.

### 👀 3.2 View the Image

Navigate to the corresponding project and repository to confirm that your uploaded image is successfully displayed in the repository.

## ⚠️ 4. Common Issues

### ❌ 4.1 Login Failed

- Ensure that the username and password are correct.
- Check that the Harbor URL is correct and that the network can access it.

### ❌ 4.2 Push Failed

- Ensure that the path of the image tag is correct.
- Check whether you have permission to push the image to the specified project and repository.
